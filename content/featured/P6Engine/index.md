A 3D game framework composed of character elements, providing a basic construction framework and common tools, supporting the basic operation of games, managing various elements in the game, calculating their state changes, and generating three-dimensional game scenes spliced with characters as pixels.

Developed with native C/C++ and STL, capable of reading 3D model files in obj format, implemented a camera using a self-derived imaging formula, skeleton and skinning with linked lists, and functions such as axis rotation, horizontal and vertical FOV conversion using the Bresenham algorithm, and propagated skeleton influences using message queues.
